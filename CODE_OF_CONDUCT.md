# Project Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our project community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, background, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other personal attribute. We are committed to maintaining an inclusive and respectful environment.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards others.
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Providing and receiving constructive feedback graciously.
- Taking responsibility for our actions, apologizing when necessary, and learning from our mistakes.
- Prioritizing the well-being of the community as a whole.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Use of offensive or inappropriate language, imagery, or attention.
- Engaging in trolling, insulting, derogatory comments, or personal attacks.
- Harassment, whether public or private.
- Disclosing others' private information without explicit permission.
- Any other behavior that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for upholding and enforcing our standards of behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. This includes the removal or moderation of comments, commits, code, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, whether online or offline, and extends to situations where individuals represent the project in public spaces. This includes official communication channels, social media accounts, and events.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [contact@example.com](mailto:contact@example.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The privacy and security of the reporter will be respected.
